Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending
Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize
you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm".  So
B.M. can have his "temporary atheists" whenever he needs them and all the
"temporary atheists" can later say that they were always good Muslims because
they never explicitly rejected Islam.

Temporary atheism, temporary Islam, temporary marriage.  None of it sticks.
A teflon religion.  How convenient.  And so easy to clean up after.  But
then, what would you expect from a bunch of people who can't even agree on
the phases of the moon?
