True enough.  O.K., in the universe we have today, which is better, a science
that predicts the motion of the planets, and it happens so, or a science
which predicts that sonic the hedgehog will record an album with Elvis on
a certain date, and it doesn't happen?  Can the answer to this question
be called objective, or is it a matter of opinion?
