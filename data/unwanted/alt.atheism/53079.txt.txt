No, I'm using definition (3), or perhaps (4) in both cases.  If there
is no objective worth, usefulness, or importance then science has no
objective worth, usefulness, or importance.  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable, then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable. Do you see any flaws in this?

If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,
or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in
dealing with observed facts.  Alternatively, you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy
or important in any situation.   In other words, I need to know
how you use the term "objective".
