Yes:

If one's particular goal is to land a man on the moon, or to
put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate;
then orbital astronomy will be more important.

However, if one is a particular fan Sonic's singing, or a competator
of Sonic, say Mario and the Toadstools; knowing when he will record an ablum
would be more important.

I fail to see how this is connected in any way, nor where you are
driving too.
