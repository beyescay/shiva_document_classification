One need not have have the notion that science is useful. For
example: many Christian scientists do not believe medical science to be
usefor or worthy. That does not make medical science subjective.

In any event, I fail to see what you mean by "subjective" science.
Are you suggesting that it is, and that if I step of a building, I may fall,
while you may not?

I assure you, it is a very objective conclusion that you will fall
( without any other outside means of support ). If you do not believe this,
I suggest you step off of a building, and subjectively believe that you will
not fall.
