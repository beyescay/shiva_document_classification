Look at archeobacteria - they live in areas so hot you would melt.

And, believe it or not, we use their machinery everday in the pursuit of
new drugs, therapies, and knowledge.

You mean your theory.  Again, arguing this point is like telling a child
that the sky will not fall.  If the child is stubborn you will not get anywhere.

The P=1.  They are left handed :)  Really, this is not a big deal.  There are
many problems with abiogenisis but these are really trivial.

Please Jack rad some modern biololgy - i do not mean books by creationists
about modern biology.  Pick up a text book and read.  I think you
would like Woose's "On the Origins."  He is an arogant man but his writting
and research is brilliant.
