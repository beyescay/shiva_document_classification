Twaddle. You're overloading the meaning of the word "value",
that's all. Whether I care if the results are true is a "value".
I fail to see how whether they are true (correct, whatever) is
a value.

You're overloading the value of worth, too.

Like I said before, DES works whether I value my privacy or
not.
