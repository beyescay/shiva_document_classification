Good question.  Under the assumption that things are as they are,
and the seller is not the owner (I assume this is what you mean)
then one can say that with high confidence that this is a bad deal
for any tourist, regardless of their private beliefs.  There isn't
enough information to draw good conclusions about the seller - but one
could say (with less confidence) that it can be a good deal for any seller.
That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is
*not* relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can
predict this, which sounds pretty objective to me.
