The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it, if you
care to look at it that way - however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth, unless you care to follow the (a?)
procedure to obtain truth ("science") correctly.  You have to pick
the right procedure, and note its importance.  You've got to value it.
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth, and shouldn't object
to the statement "objectivism is true".

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,
science cannot be valued non-subjectively.   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively, then we are using a maybe-not-quite-sure
method on maybe-not-quite-sure observations.  That should lead
to maybe-not-quite-sure results, no?  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise, which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable.

No, wait - I've a better idea:  "And the result's actual truth is..."?
Yeah, that's the ticket.

#Like I said before, DES works whether I value my privacy or
#not.

O.K., which DES?  The abstract function DES? that stops working in any
important sense if no-one cares for the importance of truth, mathematics,
meaning, information, etc.  A DES chip or DES s/w?  That stops working in any
important sense if no-one values science, objective reality, etc.   DES
does not work in a value vacuum.  Nothing else does, either.
