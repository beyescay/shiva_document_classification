To repeat what I had said in an earlier post:  Evolution is
a theory.  If you accept it as fact, then that is faith and
not much different from religion.  If you accept it as the
theory it is, then there is 0% religion involved and it
can be quite useful in the realm of science.

Simply put, evolution/creation when each is looked at
properly -- theory/assertion not fact/fiction -- is a
specific example of exactly what separates soft athiesm
and science from religion.
