This is sort of like asking an atheist "would you like to prove that God
doesn't exist"?  Doubting something does not imply affirming the contrary.

For that matter, what if I don't accept the concept that there is something as
well-defined as "Western policies", but only that there are policies of
individual Westerners which do not form a coherent combined policy?
