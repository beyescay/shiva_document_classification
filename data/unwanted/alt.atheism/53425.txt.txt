Dress casual. Only in heaven is there a dress code (black tie and
self-important expression)

Don't forget to sing:
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
Only the good die young!
