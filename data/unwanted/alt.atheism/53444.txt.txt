Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different
than interpretations of those raw facts.

That might seem like a good first pass guess, but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things, because we all seem to
have rather different opinions (experiences) about what is good
and evil, while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says.

See above. We can't seem to agree on what's better.

I don't see that it's any evidence at all.
As I point out above, I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is. I'm prepared to trust--to some extent--
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own. However, if everyone
else said the dial read 1.5 and it looked like a 3 to me, I would
hope that I would believe myself. I.e. believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself, but the possibility exists
that it is not. Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good, I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion.
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus, actually.

Perhaps true, but I didn't make assertions about what you believed.
You did.
