Yes, when you tag on the "Unfortunately, ...", then to all intents and
purposes you are saying the same thing.

#Would you say this of any two statements, one saying "X is moral" and

What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator.

That's not true.  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum
force and still be a pacifist.  If the minimum is 0, great  - but one is
always trying to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief.
Not the same as 'force is immoral, period', but still tending to pacifism.
