"Correct" overstates the case.  The whole point of the discussions
has been that it is *reasonable* to assume that there was some brief
reference to Jesus that has been doctored.  By consensus, this is
the *most* reasonable of the proposed solutions -- but not so much
so as to rule out complete fabrication.
