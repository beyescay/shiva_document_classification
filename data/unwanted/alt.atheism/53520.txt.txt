Too bad you're starting off with a faulty translation. Try this instead:

When God began to create heaven and earth -- the earth being unformed
and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God
sweeping over the water -- God said, "Let there be light"; and there was
light. God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from
the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness He called
Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.
