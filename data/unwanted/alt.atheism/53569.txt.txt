Although I agree that creation is nonsense, I submit that you are making
the same mistake that creationists commonly do.  In this and previous posts,
I think you have been engaging in the fallacy of false dichotomy; you have
consistently characterized science/religion as rationalism/nonsense, when
in fact the latter do not form a complete set of options.  Neither do the
former, for that matter.

I wish that the semi-explicit linking of evolution to so-called "rational"
atheism could be avoided; it just gives the creationists fuel for their
often-repeated incantation that "evolution leads to atheism."
