True, by "correct" I mean "the thing valued is really good".  I should
use evaluative terms, but I don't always.  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing.
Can you answer if "betterness" is used in in place of @correctness"?

#Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with
#the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a
#meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is
#irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that
#one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make
#value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"
#of the position.

You can never say that the thing is @really better@, or "more likely
to better, from all realistic frames of reference"?

#Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is
#that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,
#neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold
#different moral values (feelings).

This is where my difficulty arises, though I'm starting to get
in now.  The thing is, there isn't anything simple about different
moral values, when those values are human rights.

Peculiar - you're getting relativism from this, I'm getting
objectivism :-)  Good book, though, and a good quote.
