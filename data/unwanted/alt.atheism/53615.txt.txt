The *basis*, Eric, is people peering at the world and saying what
they see.  I'm talking about uninterpreted facts - observations.  _People_
do those.  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory
that is more than personal.

I know this.  You know this.  Can we proceed?

#That might seem like a good first pass guess, but it turns out to
#be a pretty cruddy way to look at things, because we all seem to
#have rather different opinions (experiences) about what is good
#and evil, while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says.

You're not comparing apples with apples.  If we all look at the same meter,
we'll agree.  If we're all in the same situation, that's when we'll
agree on fundamental values, if at all.  People who say that nobody agrees on
values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem
to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either.

#See above. We can't seem to agree on what's better.

See above.  We sometimes can.  There is also the matter of inertia
against experimentation.  Most, if not all, moral hypotheses are necessarily
tested by way of thought experiment.  Few people will attempt genocide
or experience a lifetime in jail to find out if it's really as bad as
all that.

#I don't see that it's any evidence at all.
#As I point out above, I'm really not interested very much in
#what the popular opinion is. I'm prepared to trust--to some extent--
#the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
#because by and large they accord with my own. However, if everyone
#else said the dial read 1.5 and it looked like a 3 to me, I would
#hope that I would believe myself. I.e. believing other people about
#these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
#what I would believe if I observed myself, but the possibility exists
#that it is not. Since I know from observation that others disagree
#with me about what is good, I believe I can discount popular opinion
#about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion.
#I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
#people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
#is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus, actually.

Firstly, if everyone else said the dial was 1.5 and I saw 3, I'd check
my lens prescription.  Secondly, your observation that people
disagree shows nothing - people may be looking at different things,
by virtue of being in different situations.  If I look at an elephant, I'll
see an elephant.  That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you
look at an iguana.    Thirdly, I question your assumption that when
people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals, that
they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals (that seems to be the
disagreement you refer to).
