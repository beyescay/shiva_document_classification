Or, you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor.  If you take
a look at Quantum Mechanics, many objective observations can be made
as well.  However, Physics is not objective.  Bohr said the randomness
of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself.  Einstein said that
nature is deterministic; it is our method of observation that inserts the
randomness.  They were talking about the exact same results.

Depends on how you look at it, I guess.
