But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways, correct? If I wanted to
know the "truth" about, say, the specific gravity of chicken soup, I could
employ science -- meters, gauges, scales, etc. -- or I could just talk a walk
on a beach somewhere. Both have a possibility of generating the truthful
answer -- in the case of the walk on the beach, it would have to be some sort
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just
happened to be truthful -- so what makes me choose the scientific method of
truth-determination over the "walk on the beach" method? Because I *VALUE*
science's higher probability of obtaining truth, that's why. Everywhere one
turns, there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the
veneer of detached objectivity. It is an inescapable aspect of the human
condition.

Well, I would add that the attribute "works even when not being measured" is
*ALSO* something which is valued and intended, Eric. All you've succeeded in
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values.
