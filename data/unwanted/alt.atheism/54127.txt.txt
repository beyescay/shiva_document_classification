The "R Us" thing is trademarked.  I don't know if Charles
Lazarus is dead or alive, but I'd be careful, because with
a name like Lazarus, he might rise again just to start a
lawsuit.

(I knew an architect once who, I swear, was employed to design
the signs for the Toys R Us and Kids R Us stores.  The signs.
The things they stick over the store or up on a big pole so they
can be seen from the highway.  What a job.  All those hours in
school studying to be an architect so you can tell them to move
the pole ten feet closer to the highway.)
