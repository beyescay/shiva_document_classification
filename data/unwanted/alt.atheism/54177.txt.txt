Ooooops!  Jack, you forgot to expunge one part of your new ripped-out-of-context
quote.  That's the last line.  Here Eldridge is talking about disagreement over
the various theories (themes).  We all know about that.  We also know that
nobody in the "warring camps" doubts the fact of evolution.  You see, if you
had clipped the last line, you could have made it look like even evolutionary
biologists are doubting the fact of evolution.  That's what you wanted to do,
isn't it?  Boy oh boy!, do you need to sharpen up your quote clippers or what?

By the way, what's an "anth[r]opological parallel?"
