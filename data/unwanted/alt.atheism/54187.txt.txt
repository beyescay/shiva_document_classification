When they're not important, yes.  All scientists do.  Otherwise science would
never get anywhere.

Hang about -- not atomic interactions in general.  Just specific ones which
are deemed unimportant.  Like gravitational interactions between ions, which
are so small they're drowned out by electrostatic effects, and so on.

Oh, probably.  They still make people memorize equations and IR spectra.
Maybe in a few decades they'll discover the revolutionary "data book"
technique.
