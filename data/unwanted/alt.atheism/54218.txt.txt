You mean Bobby Mozumder is a myth?    We wondered about that.

You mean Bobby Mozumder didn't really post here?   We wondered
about that, too.

So, Mr Conner.   Is Bobby Mozumder a myth, a performing artist,
a real Moslem. a crackpot, a provocateur?    You know everything
and read all minds: why don't you tell us?
